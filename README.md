OrangeSquash
===========

A summer project in C++ that will hopefully be useful.

Uses standard C++ libraries and requires mplayer to be installed and accessed at path "/usr/bin/mplayer"

This project is not yet completed, but if you want to try it out, run the Makefile using the make the commnd and execute the compiled binary using "./OrangeSquash"

During development of this project files will continually be changing and new files added. The main.cpp file contains some semblance to what the final program may contain but may also frequently contain temporary test code.
